- Code cleanup and refactor


# Upcoming Features

## Prompt to create arbitrary cognitive filters

## Tiktok

## Facebook

## Custom filters
- Defined by the types of content you choose to see.

## Dialectical Countering
- Inject counter content
- e.g. homeless child star: homelessness trends from official databases, and counter-meme showing improvements and interventions

## Intent Matching

## Community-archive integration
- Optional send posts to db

## Adaptation tracking. Log what types of content the platform is serving over time. Show the user: "This week Twitter tried: outrage bait (blocked), engagement farming (blocked), celebrity content (blocked). It's running out of moves."

## manipulation taxonomy tracking. Not just scoring individual posts, but tracking what categories of manipulation the algorithm is currently trying on you. Over time you'd see patterns:

"Twitter is currently probing you with: outrage (blocked) → celebrity (testing) → nostalgia (queued)"
